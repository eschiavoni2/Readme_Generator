# Readme_Generator

## Description

This readme generator creates an easy to look at file for anyone looking at my work. This can improve any project, and make a good project even better. A readme can be created by utilizing node.js and downloading inquirer. We also needed to add a snippet. Doing things this way can save time, and make any project excel. Building this project gives me the tools to improve my projects in the future. A readme generator solves the issue of dull readme files, and allows for more features.
